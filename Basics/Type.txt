Conversion happens when: (widening)
a. type compatible
b. Destination type > Source type

byte -> short -> int -> long -> double
                int -> float -> double 

Type promotion in expressions:
1. Java automatically promotes each byte, short or char operand to int when evaluating an expression.
2. If one operand is long, float or double the whole expression is promoted to long, float or double respectively.
