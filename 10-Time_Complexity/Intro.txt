Time Complexity:

Order Complexity Analysis:
Amount of Space or Time taken up by an algorithm / code as function of input size.
In simple words, Relationship between Time / Space and input size
NOT the actual time taken

Note: We always try to find worst case time complexity.

Big O notation:
Upper bound of the complexity.
Ex: f(n) = 2n^2 + 3n + 5   -->   g(n) = n^2

Big Omega notation:
Lower bound of the complexity.

Big theta notation:
Average case of the complexity.


Common Complexity: O(1), O(log n), O(n), O(n^2), O(2^n).


Space Complexity:

sc = input space + auxilary space
