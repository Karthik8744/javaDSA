Recursion is a method of solving a computational problem where,
the solution depends on the solution to smaller instances of the same problem.

- Always define your base case.

Stack Overflow:

The stack overflow generally signals a problem in resource provisioning 
and has to be fixed in order to allow the program to run and use memory properly
Mainlyc caused due to the absence of base case
