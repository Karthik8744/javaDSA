- A string is an object that represents a number of character values.
- Each letter in the string is a separate character value that makes up the Java string object.
- Characters in Java are represented by the char class.
- Users can write an array of char values that will mean the same thing as a string.

⭐ Interning ⭐
Two reference variable with same value points towards same string in memory pool(i.e; intern pool)

The reference variables points towards Strings in the memory, unlike other data types which are stored in variables.

- Strings are ⭐IMMUTABLE⭐
- If we make any changes in the string then a new string(if does not exist) is created and the variable points to the newly created string


- length() in string.length() is a function
- length in arr.length() is a property
