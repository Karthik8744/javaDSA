String str = "Tony"

for (ch = 'a' to 'z') {
    str += ch;
}

To implement the above statement using strings it will create 26 unique strings in memory which is ineffective
Ex: Tonya, Tonyab, Tonyabc, ... , Tonyabc...xy, Tonyabc...xyz

which is very ineffective
The above code takes Time complexity O(m*n)≈O(n²) m is no.of times loop run and n is size of the string 
Instead String Builder would take only O(n) i.e; O(26)
